🚗 Car Running Cost Estimator
📌 Project Overview
This is a web application that estimates the annual running costs of a car based on:
✔️ Fuel efficiency (MPG)
✔️ Road tax
✔️ Insurance group
✔️ User's annual mileage

The tool helps new drivers and car buyers quickly assess potential costs before choosing a vehicle. I've developed this based on an assignment I've asked a class of my learners to create. They are young learners how are mostly 18. I've noticed a few times that they visit Autotrader when they should be doing other things. I decided to create a programming assignment question which is essentially this app as I hoped it would be motivating as well as educational (I've noticed they sometimes look at cars they have no hope of insuring!). I've included some of those cars for references as well as mostly sensible first time driver cars. In their case they are going to develop to app with Python using Tkinter. I thought developing this myself might aid me in supporting them with the logic involved though.
